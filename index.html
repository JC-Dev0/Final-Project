        <h1 style="text-align: center">Historical Background</h1>
        <p>
          In 1690, the town of Enrile was a virgin forest on the southernmost
          portion of the province of Cagayan. In 1724 or thereabouts, it was
          named Cabug, a barrio of Tuguegarao City and it now celebrates its
          feast day on August 6, later changed to August 5, in honor of its
          Patron Saint Nuestra Senoŕa de las Caldas. In the chronicle of Fray
          Julian Manumbres, Cabug as a geographical unit was officially recorded
          on January 20, 1849. And although the name Enrile was officially
          written and read in the records of the Dominicans up to 1863, the town
          of Enrile was still known as “Cabug”. Kalingas, the early settlers,
          were later joined by neighbor inhabitants in the cleaning and
          cultivating its rich soil. They plowed and planted the fields with
          staple products and tobacco. With the increasing production and number
          of educated elders, the Gobierno Superior proclaimed “Cabug” separated
          from Tuguegarao City in 1849, with a new patroness named Nuestra
          Senoŕa de las Nieves. This proclamed “Cabug” as “Enrile” in honor of
          Gobernardo General Pascual Enrile, who was responsible for the
          construction of Luzon’s highways. Sinupac, a hinterland of Enrile, was
          the hiding place of Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary forces when
          they retreated from pursuing American forces. Today the town of Enrile
          not only boasts of its peaceful,orderly conditions and its competent
          professionals, but also of its rapidly growing hog and poultry
          industry.

        <h1>Peanut Production</h1>
        <p>
          The Department of Agriculture (DA) has declared the town of Enrile in
          Cagayan as the "peanut capital of the Philippines" for its "noteworthy
          contribution" to the development of the local peanut industry, with
          experts citing the soil suitability of the town sandy to sandy-loam
          and its unique ability to produce peanut year-round. One estimate of
          the town's production places a volume of 1,800 metric tons per year or
          8 to 10 percent of the national supply. Enrile is home to 800 peanut
          farmers cultivating 700 hectares of farmlands with a potential
          expansion area of another 800 hectares. "With improved production and
          yield, Enrile may be able to fill up a portion, if not all, of the
          import requirement for peanut of 15,060 metric tons". <br />
          The sustainability of a peanut farming community hinges on
          understanding the key production players in the supply chain. This
          agenda-setting paper focused on presenting and analyzing the
          production and marketing experiences of 75 peanut farmers in Enrile,
          Cagayan, Philippines, using the case methodology through farmer
          surveys, key informant interviews, and secondary sources of
          information. This paper aims to present sustainability perspectives to
          revitalize peanut farming in the area and address the issues
          encountered in the production and marketing of peanuts. The results of
          this study showed that peanut farming in the community can be
          revitalized and sustained through instituting effective flood control
          measures, improving peanut farming practices, employing market-driven
          strategies supported by supply chain and quality management, nurturing
          the next generation of peanut farmers, and establishing better
          linkages with support institutions and industry.
